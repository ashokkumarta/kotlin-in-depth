# Kotlin-in-depth

## About this repo
 - This repo contains code samples and exercises done when exploring Kotlin
 - Each source file by itself is independent and self contained. Each file has a main function which can be executed to run the code 
 - For the above reason, there would be repition across the source file
 - This is not intended to be a framework or API of any sort.  
 - Folder structure and organization of code is only for code classification and does not refelct package structure or module organization
 - Not much care has been taken to ensure code is of good quality. 
  - At best, it can be used as reference for learning Kotlin in depth
